- **Llama Copilot**: Advanced AI functionalities for various applications.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted development tools for enhanced productivity.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports robotics, laptops, and Android devices.

## Requirements
- **Rust**: Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow library for machine learning functionalities.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Integrated development environment with Copilot support.
- **Build Tools**: CMake, Ninja, or other required build tools.
- **Hardware**: Compatible with x86_64 and ARM architectures.

## Installation
1. **Install Rust**:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Install TensorFlow**:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

3. **Set Up GitHub Copilot**:
   Follow the [official GitHub Copilot documentation](https://github.com/features/copilot) to set up Copilot in your preferred IDE.

## Building EvoOS
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/evoos.git
cd evoos
```

### Step 2: Configure the Build
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

### Step 3: Build the Kernel
```sh
make
```

### Step 4: Install EvoOS
```sh
sudo make install
```

## Kernel OS Structure
The EvoOS kernel is organized to ensure modularity, ease of maintenance, and scalability. Below is the detailed structure:

### Directory Layout
- **src/**: Contains the core kernel code written in Rust.
  - **main.rs**: Entry point of the kernel.
  - **lib.rs**: Core library functionalities.
  - **arch/**: Architecture-specific code.
    - **x86_64/**: x86_64 architecture-specific implementations.
    - **arm/**: ARM architecture-specific implementations.
  - **drivers/**: Hardware drivers for various devices.
    - **network/**: Network drivers.
    - **storage/**: Storage device drivers.
    - **graphics/**: Graphics drivers.
  - **memory/**: Memory management subsystem.
  - **process/**: Process and thread management.
  - **scheduler/**: Task scheduling algorithms.
  - **fs/**: File system implementations.
  - **syscall/**: System call interface.

### Important Files
- **Cargo.toml**: Cargo configuration file for Rust dependencies and project metadata.
- **config/**: Configuration files for build and deployment.
- **docs/**: Documentation and design specifications.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and integration tests for the OS components.

### Adding New Modules
1. **Create a New Module Directory**: 
   ```sh
   mkdir src/module_name
   ```
2. **Implement the Module**: Create the necessary Rust files and implement the module functionalities.
3. **Update Cargo.toml**: Add the new module to the dependencies.

### Example: Adding a New Driver
1. **Create Driver Directory**:
   ```sh
   mkdir src/drivers/new_driver
   ```
2. **Implement Driver**:
   - Create `src/drivers/new_driver/mod.rs`:
     ```rust
     pub fn initialize() {
         // Driver initialization code
     }
     ```
   - Add any additional files required for the driver implementation.
3. **Register Driver** in `src/main.rs`:
   ```rust
   mod drivers;
   use drivers::new_driver;

   fn main() {
       new_driver::initialize();
       // Other initialization code
   }
   ```

## Development
### Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Install VSCode**:
   ```sh
   sudo snap install code --classic
   ```
   
2. **Install Rust Extension**:
   Open VSCode and install the Rust extension from the Extensions marketplace.

3. **Enable GitHub Copilot**:
   Follow the setup instructions to enable GitHub Copilot in VSCode.

### Development Workflow
1. **Create a New Branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
2. **Implement the Feature**: Develop the feature in the appropriate directory.
3. **Run Tests**:
   ```sh
   cargo test
   ```
4. **Commit Changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Implement feature-name"
   ```
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push the branch to the remote repository and open a pull request for review.
