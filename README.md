  - **arch/**: Architecture-specific code.
    - **x86_64/**: x86_64 architecture-specific implementations.
    - **arm/**: ARM architecture-specific implementations.
  - **drivers/**: Hardware drivers for various devices.
    - **network/**: Network drivers.
    - **storage/**: Storage device drivers.
    - **graphics/**: Graphics drivers.
  - **memory/**: Memory management subsystem.
  - **process/**: Process and thread management.
  - **scheduler/**: Task scheduling algorithms.
  - **fs/**: File system implementations.
  - **syscall/**: System call interface.

### Important Files
- **Cargo.toml**: Cargo configuration file for Rust dependencies and project metadata.
- **config/**: Configuration files for build and deployment.
- **docs/**: Documentation and design specifications.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and integration tests for the OS components.

### Adding New Modules
1. **Create a New Module Directory**: 
   ```sh

     ```rust
     pub fn initialize() {
         // Driver initialization code
     }
     ```
   - Add any additional files required for the driver implementation.
3. **Register Driver** in `src/main.rs`:
   ```rust
   mod drivers;
   use drivers::new_driver;

   fn main() {
       new_driver::initialize();
       // Other initialization code
   }
   ```
